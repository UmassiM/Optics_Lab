# Optics_Lab
Some old reports on our Optics Lab experiences while Undergraduates.\
Although not revolutionary, all analyses and findings agree with well-established physical phenomena, marking our methods as successful.\
Extensive use was made of Ne-He lasers, Polarizers, Beam Splitters, Photodiodes, Multimeters etc
